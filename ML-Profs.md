### University of Toronto Professors in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Statistical Machine Learning

Based on a comprehensive search of UofT's Statistics (STA) and Computer Science (CS) departments (as of mid-2025), I've compiled a list of relevant professors. I prioritized STA faculty, as they align best with your stats major for RA opportunities—stats students often RA in methodology-heavy areas like statistical ML or Bayesian methods. For CS professors, I focused on those with methodology emphasis (e.g., theoretical/optimization/probabilistic ML) or cross-appointments/collaborations that suggest openness to stats/math students (e.g., dual STA-CS roles or stats-focused work). These profs are more accessible for non-CS backgrounds, as their research intersects with stats/math foundations.

RA tips: As a stats major with 3.9 CGPA, email profs directly (include CV, relevant courses like STA257/261, interest in their work). STA RAs are common for undergrads via UTSSRP (summer research program). CS labs (e.g., Vector Institute affiliates) sometimes take stats RAs if methodology fits. Check prof pages for openings; apply early for fall/winter.

#### STA Department Professors (Ideal for Stats Majors)
These are directly from STA, with heavy methodology research—easier entry for you via shared stats foundation. Many supervise stats PhDs/RAs.

## Response:
In-Depth Analysis of Your Top Choice: Dr. Bo Wang at U ofT
----------------------------------------------------------

You've made an excellent and highly strategic choice in identifying **Dr. Bo Wang** as your top prospect. His work is a perfect storm of your stated interests: cutting-edge machine learning applied directly to computational biology, with a significant focus on topics relevant to aging and longevity. He is a rising star in a field that is exploding with opportunity.

Here is a comprehensive analysis of Dr. Wang, his research, and a strategic plan for how you, as a statistics major, can position yourself as an ideal candidate for a Research Assistant (RA) position in his lab.

### Dr. Bo Wang: A Profile

| Title | Primary Appointment | Affiliations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assistant Professor | **Department of Computer Science** | Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre (UHN) |
| AI Chair | CIFAR |     |

Dr. Wang's position is a clear indicator of his interdisciplinary nature. While his home is in Computer Science, his deep affiliations with the Vector Institute (Canada's premier AI research hub) and the Faculty of Medicine show that his work is not just about algorithms, but about solving real-world biological and clinical problems.

### Research Focus: The Intersection of AI and Health

Dr. Wang's research lab focuses on creating novel machine learning models to analyze large-scale, multi-modal biomedical data. His goal is to uncover insights that can lead to better disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

His key research pillars, highly relevant to your interests, include:

1.  **Computational Biology & Genomics:** This is the core of his work. He develops models to interpret complex biological data like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and histology images. This is directly related to understanding the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease.
2.  **Deep Learning for Healthcare:** He is a leader in applying advanced deep learning architectures (Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, Generative Models) to medical challenges.
3.  **Interpretable & Trustworthy AI:** A crucial theme in his work is moving beyond "black box" models. He aims to create AI systems whose decisions can be understood by clinicians and biologists, which is critical for real-world medical adoption.
4.  **Longevity and Aging:** While not always the explicit title, his research on understanding cellular states, disease progression, and the fundamental drivers of biology is the bedrock of computational approaches to longevity. Analyzing how cells change over time or under stress is, in essence, studying the aging process at a molecular level.

### Why He is an Excellent Fit for a Statistics Major

You might think a CS professor is a long shot, but Dr. Wang's research is arguably a better fit for a strong stats/math student than many pure CS labs. Here's why:

*   **Data is Probabilistic, Not Deterministic:** Biological data is inherently noisy and stochastic. The models used to interpret it are fundamentally statistical. Your background in probability theory, statistical inference, and modeling is a massive advantage.
*   **Methodology is Key:** His lab doesn't just _apply_ existing models; they _create new ones_. This involves a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics of machine learning. Your stats/math background allows you to grasp the "why" behind the models, not just the "how."
*   **Single-Cell Genomics is a Statistical Playground:** Analyzing single-cell data involves high-dimensional statistics, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), clustering, and differential expression analysis—all topics rooted in statistics.
*   **Interpretable AI Relies on Statistical Concepts:** Techniques for model interpretability often draw from concepts like information theory, causal inference, and statistical testing.

### Strategic Plan: How to Become an Ideal RA Candidate for Dr. Wang

Your goal is to demonstrate that you are not just another student looking for a big name, but a candidate with the specific skills and intellectual curiosity to contribute to _his_ research.

**Phase 1: Deep Preparation (Now - 2 Months)**

1.  **Master His Domain:** Go to his lab's website and his Google Scholar page. Pick 2-3 of his most recent, interesting papers (especially those in top venues like _Nature Methods_, NeurIPS, or ICML). Don't just read the abstract; try to understand:
    *   **The Problem:** What biological question were they trying to answer?
    *   **The Data:** What kind of data did they use (e.g., scRNA-seq, histology)?
    *   **The Model:** What was the core machine learning innovation? Was it a new type of Graph Neural Network? A novel attention mechanism?
    *   **The Statistical Foundation:** Where is the statistics? Is it in the model's probabilistic assumptions? In the validation framework?
2.  **Acquire Foundational Domain Knowledge:** You don't need to be a biologist, but you need to speak the language. Use online resources (like Coursera or edX) to take a crash course in:
    *   **Introduction to Genomics / Computational Biology:** Understand concepts like DNA, RNA, gene expression, and sequencing.
    *   **Single-Cell Analysis:** Learn what scRNA-seq data looks like and the standard analysis pipelines (e.g., using packages like Scanpy in Python).
3.  **Sharpen Your Technical Skills:**
    *   **Python:** Become an expert. Your toolbox must include `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
    *   **Deep Learning Framework:** Master **PyTorch**. It is the standard in academia. Go through the official tutorials and be comfortable building and training neural networks.
    *   **GitHub:** Build a clean, professional GitHub profile. Complete a project related to his work (see next point).

**Phase 2: The Proof-of-Work Project (2-4 Months)**

This is what will set you apart. Instead of just saying you're interested, _show him_.

*   **Project Idea:** Find a public dataset similar to one he has used (e.g., from the Gene Expression Omnibus or a Kaggle competition). Re-implement the core idea from one of his recent papers on this new dataset.
*   **Don't Just Copy:** Add a small, smart twist. Can you simplify the model? Can you visualize the results in a more intuitive way? Can you test its robustness to noise?
*   **Document Everything:** Host the project on your GitHub with a clear `README.md` file explaining the project's goal, your methodology, and your results. Use Jupyter notebooks to make your code and analysis easy to follow.

**Phase 3: The Approach (Targeting Early Fall Semester)**

1.  **Craft the Perfect Email:** This is your one shot. It must be concise, professional, and targeted.
    *   **Subject:** `Prospective Undergraduate RA Inquiry: [Your Name], Statistics Major with Interest in Computational Biology`
    *   **Body:**
        *   **Paragraph 1: Introduction.** "My name is \[Your Name\], a \[Your Year\] undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at UofT. I am writing to express my strong interest in a Research Assistant position in your lab."
        *   **Paragraph 2: Demonstrate Knowledge.** "I have been following your lab's work on \[Mention a specific research area, e.g., 'graph neural networks for single-cell data analysis'\]. I was particularly fascinated by your recent paper, '\[Paper Title\],' and its approach to \[Mention a specific technical detail\]. The way you used \[Specific Method\] to solve \[Specific Problem\] was especially insightful."
        *   **Paragraph 3: Showcase Your Value.** "My coursework in \[e.g., STA302, STA314, MAT237\] has given me a strong foundation in statistical theory and mathematical modeling. To apply these skills, I developed a personal project where I \[Briefly describe your proof-of-work project, e.g., 're-implemented the core model from your paper on a new public dataset to analyze...'\]. You can find the project here on my GitHub: \[Link\]."
        *   **Paragraph 4: The Ask.** "I am eager to contribute to your research and confident that my quantitative background would be a valuable asset to your team. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute meeting to discuss any potential opportunities? I have attached my CV and unofficial transcript for your review."

By following this plan, you transform from a student asking for a favor into a prospective colleague offering tangible value. You are showing Dr. Wang that you are proactive, technically capable, and genuinely invested in his specific field of research—the three most important qualities he is looking for in a student.
