\# Strategic Outreach Plan: University of Toronto Research Opportunities



This document outlines a prioritized list of faculty members and research labs at the University of Toronto who are prime targets for a Research Assistant (RA) position. Securing a role with one of these individuals would significantly bolster an application to elite master's programs such as the Master of Mathematical Finance (MMF), Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF), and Master of Financial Insurance (MFI).



\## Tier 1: The Bullseye Targets (Direct Alignment with MMF/MFI/MQF)



These professors are at the core of quantitative finance and risk management at UofT. An RAship with any of them would be a powerful signal to the admissions committees of your target programs.



\### Department of Statistical Sciences



This is the home department and should be the primary focus. These faculty members are most familiar with the undergraduate curriculum and are actively shaping the graduate programs of interest.



| Professor | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Outreach |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Sebastian Jaimungal\*\* | Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Trading, Stochastic Control, Mean-Field Games, Machine Learning in Finance. | \*\*The Perfect Fit:\*\* Professor Jaimungal's work is the ideal synthesis of your interests. He is the \*\*Chair of the Department\*\* and the \*\*Director of the MFI program\*\*, making him a supremely influential figure. An outreach email should highlight a strong GPA and specific interest in his application of reinforcement learning to algorithmic trading, bridging a CS/Stats background with the goal of using advanced modeling to find leverage in markets. |

| \*\*Silvana Pesenti\*\* | Quantitative Risk Management, Insurance Risk, Model Uncertainty, Stress Testing, Sensitivity Analysis. | \*\*The MFI Gateway:\*\* Professor Pesenti's research is at the heart of modern insurance and financial risk management, making her a key contact for the MFI program. Her work on model uncertainty and stress testing is highly relevant to risk analyst roles. Frame your interest around applying statistical modeling skills to the complex dependence structures in insurance risk. |

| \*\*Zhou Zhou\*\* | Time Series Analysis, Non-parametric Inference, with applications to finance and economics. | \*\*The Foundational Skill-Builder:\*\* Time series analysis is the bedrock of quantitative finance. An RAship with Professor Zhou would provide a deep, fundamental skill. You can connect your interest to the challenge of modeling non-stationary financial data, a complex problem that requires deep, focused thinking. |

| \*\*Radu Craiu\*\* | Bayesian Inference, Computational Methods (MCMC), Copula Models, Statistical Genetics. | \*\*The Computational Powerhouse:\*\* Professor Craiu's expertise in advanced computational methods is highly sought after in the financial industry for modeling complex dependencies and risks. You can pitch your value by highlighting your CS minor and your desire to apply sophisticated Bayesian techniques to financial problems. |



\### Rotman School of Management



| Professor | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Outreach |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*John Hull\*\* | Machine Learning in Finance, Derivatives, Risk Management, Stochastic Volatility. | \*\*The Industry Titan:\*\* Professor Hull is a world-renowned figure whose textbooks are industry standard. His recent focus on machine learning applications in finance is a perfect intersection of skills and goals. An outreach should emphasize technical skills (Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow) and your desire to apply them to practical financial problems. |

\## Tier 2: The Strategic Cross-Disciplinary Targets



These professors are in adjacent departments but their work is highly relevant to quantitative finance. An RAship here would showcase the ability to apply skills in an interdisciplinary context.



\### Faculty of Applied Science \& Engineering



| Professor | Department | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Outreach |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Roy H. Kwon\*\* | MIE | Financial Optimization, Portfolio Optimization, Risk Management, Operations Research. | \*\*The Optimization Expert:\*\* Professor Kwon is the \*\*Chair of the Engineering Mathematics, Statistics and Finance (MSF) major\*\* and a faculty member in the MMF program. This is a direct bridge from a theoretical math background to applied finance. Highlight interest in his work on portfolio optimization and risk management. |

| \*\*Chi-Guhn Lee\*\* | MIE | Stochastic Systems, Operations Research, Financial Engineering, Supply Chain Management. | \*\*The Stochastic Modeler:\*\* Professor Lee's work in stochastic systems and operations research has direct applications in financial engineering. This aligns with the goal of developing a deep, theoretical skill set and applying it to create value. |



\### Department of Mathematics



| Professor | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Outreach |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Luis Seco\*\* | Mathematical Finance, Asset Management, Machine Learning, Climate Risk, Sustainability. | \*\*The Visionary Leader:\*\* As the \*\*Director of RiskLab\*\* and the \*\*Director of the MMF Program\*\*, Professor Seco is a central figure in the Toronto quantitative finance community. Frame your interest as a desire to use your quantitative skills to tackle complex, high-impact problems like climate risk. |

| \*\*Robert McCann\*\* | Optimization, Mathematical Economics, Partial Differential Equations. | \*\*The Theoretical Heavyweight:\*\* Professor McCann's work is highly theoretical but foundational to modern mathematical economics and optimization. This path is for those who want to double down on the "deep skill" aspect of their plan, appealing to a genuine love for the rigor of advanced mathematics. |

| \*\*Jeremy Quastel\*\*| Stochastic Processes, Probability Theory, Partial Differential Equations. | \*\*The Master of Stochastics:\*\* Professor Quastel is a world-leading expert in stochastic processes, the mathematical language of finance. An RAship with him would be an intense, theory-focused experience that would provide an unparalleled foundation for any MMF or MQF program. |

\## Affiliated Research Centers: The Hubs of Innovation



Gaining experience at these centers provides direct exposure to the intersection of academia and industry.



| Center | Key Faculty | Research Focus | Strategic Angle for Outreach |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*RiskLab\*\* | \*\*Luis Seco (Director)\*\*, and other affiliated faculty. | Machine Learning, Mathematical \& Financial Modelling, ESG \& Sustainability. | \*\*The Industry-Academia Bridge:\*\* RiskLab is a premier research lab that explicitly collaborates with industry. Outreach should be to the lab director, Professor Seco, expressing interest in the lab's work on machine learning applications in finance and ESG. |

| \*\*Fields Institute (Quantitative Finance Seminar)\*\* | \*\*Sebastian Jaimungal (Organizer)\*\*, \*\*Silvana Pesenti (Organizer)\*\* | Derivatives Valuation, Credit Risk, Insurance, Portfolio Optimization. | \*\*The Networking Hub:\*\* While not a lab for RAships, the Fields Institute's Quantitative Finance Seminar is the central meeting point for the quant community in Toronto. Attending public seminars is an invaluable opportunity to learn about cutting-edge research and network with professors and industry professionals. |
