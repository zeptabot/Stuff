# Strategic Outreach Plan: UofT Research Opportunities for a Future in Quantitative Finance

This document outlines a targeted list of research labs and professors at the University of Toronto. Securing a Research Assistant (RA) position with one of these individuals will significantly strengthen your application for Master of Mathematical Finance (MMF), Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF), and Master of Financial Insurance (MFI) programs. Each profile includes a "Strategic Angle" to help you tailor your outreach.

## Tier 1: Core Quantitative Finance & Risk Management Targets

These professors are central to the quantitative finance and risk management research at UofT. An RAship with them provides a direct and powerful signal to the admissions committees of your target programs.

### **Department of Statistical Sciences**

This is your home department and should be your primary focus.

| Professor | Department(s) | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Your Outreach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sebastian Jaimungal** | Statistical Sciences | Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Trading, Stochastic Control, Mean-Field Games, Machine Learning in Finance. | **The Ideal Mentor:** Professor Jaimungal's work is a perfect intersection of your interests. He is the Chair of the Department and Director of the MFI program. Highlight your 3.9 GPA and specific interest in his application of reinforcement learning to algorithmic trading. This connects your CS/Stats background with your "philosopher-entrepreneur" ambition to find market leverage through advanced modeling. Demonstrating familiarity with his publicly available course materials would show exceptional initiative. |
| **Silvana Pesenti** | Statistical Sciences | Quantitative Risk Management, Insurance Risk, Model Uncertainty, Stress Testing, Sensitivity Analysis. | **The MFI Gateway:** Professor Pesenti's research is at the core of modern insurance and financial risk management. Frame your interest around applying your statistical modeling skills to the complex dependence structures in insurance risk. This field's better work-life balance aligns with your long-term goals. |
| **Zhou Zhou** | Statistical Sciences | Time Series Analysis, Non-parametric Inference, with applications to finance and economics. | **The Foundational Skill-Builder:** Time series analysis is fundamental to quantitative finance. An RAship with Professor Zhou would provide you with a deep, defensible skill. Connect your interest to the challenge of modeling non-stationary financial data, a complex problem that requires the focused, deep thinking you value. |
| **Radu Craiu** | Statistical Sciences | Bayesian Inference, Computational Methods (MCMC), Copula Models, Statistical Genetics. | **The Computational Powerhouse:** Professor Craiu's expertise in advanced computational methods is highly relevant to the financial industry. Pitch your value by highlighting your CS minor and your desire to apply sophisticated Bayesian techniques to financial problems. This aligns with your enjoyment of abstract theory and rigorous proofs. |

### **Rotman School of Management**

| Professor | Department(s) | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Your Outreach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **John Hull** | Rotman School of Management (Finance) | Machine Learning in Finance, Derivatives, Risk Management, Stochastic Volatility. | **The Industry Titan:** Professor Hull is a world-renowned figure whose textbooks are industry standard. His recent focus on machine learning in finance is a perfect intersection of your skills and goals. Your outreach should emphasize your technical skills (Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow) and your desire to apply them to practical financial problems like option hedging or volatility modeling, as discussed in his recent work. |

## Tier 2: Strategic Cross-Disciplinary Targets

These professors are in adjacent departments, but their work is highly relevant to quantitative finance. An RAship here would showcase your ability to apply your skills in an interdisciplinary context.

### **Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering**

| Professor | Department(s) | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Your Outreach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roy H. Kwon** | Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (MIE) | Financial Optimization, Portfolio Optimization, Risk Management, Operations Research. | **The Optimization Expert:** Professor Kwon is the Chair of the Engineering Mathematics, Statistics and Finance (MSF) major and a faculty member in the MMF program. His research is centered on the practical application of optimization to solve financial problems. In your email, highlight your interest in his work on portfolio optimization and risk management. |
| **Chi-Guhn Lee** | Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (MIE) | Stochastic Systems, Operations Research, Financial Engineering, Supply Chain Management. | **The Stochastic Modeler:** Professor Lee's work in stochastic systems has direct applications in financial engineering. This aligns with your goal of developing a deep, theoretical skill set and applying it to create value. |

### **Department of Mathematics**

| Professor | Department(s) | Key Research Areas | Strategic Angle for Your Outreach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Luis Seco** | Mathematics | Mathematical Finance, Asset Management, Machine Learning, Climate Risk, Sustainability. | **The Visionary Leader:** As the Director of RiskLab and the MMF Program, Professor Seco is a central figure in the Toronto quantitative finance community. Frame your interest as a desire to use your quantitative skills to tackle complex, high-impact problems, which resonates with your "philosopher" identity. An RAship at RiskLab would be a premier experience. |
| **Robert McCann** | Mathematics | Optimization, Mathematical Economics, Partial Differential Equations. | **The Theoretical Heavyweight:** Professor McCann's work is highly theoretical but foundational to modern mathematical economics and optimization. This path is for you if you want to double down on the "deep skill" aspect of your plan. |
| **Jeremy Quastel** | Mathematics | Stochastic Processes, Probability Theory, Partial Differential Equations. | **The Master of Stochastics:** Professor Quastel is a world-leading expert in stochastic processes, the mathematical language of finance. An RAship with him would be an intense, theory-focused experience that would provide an unparalleled foundation for any MMF or MQF program. |
