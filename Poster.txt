What Drives Disordered Eating? Mental Health, Habits, and Hidden Links

Introduction:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, eating disorder hospitalizations in Canada increased significantly. People diagnosed with eating disorders face a 2-5 times higher mortality risk compared to the general population (Daphne van et al.). Edakubo et al. identified three key dimensions of disordered eating behavior: Cognitive Restraint, Emotional Eating, and Uncontrolled Eating, while Leonidas et al. emphasized the role of personality traits in the development of these behaviors. The following research questions aim to provide insights that could help in the treatment and prevention of eating disorders.

Research questions:
To what extent are the three dimensions of disordered eating (Cognitive Restraint, Emotional Eating, and Uncontrolled Eating) affected by the following aspects of social well-being in individuals?
â€¢ Social Phobia
â€¢ Personality Traits
â€¢ Emotional Loneliness

Dataset:
The Canadian Social Connection Survey is a serial cross-sectional survey with a longitudinal sub-cohort designed to study the social health and well-being of Canadians in the wake of COVID-19. This dataset allows us to understand how social well-being influences individuals across different socio-demographic groups.

Sample:
We used a subset of participants from the 2023 cross-sectional study of CSCS (n=285).

Variables:

â€¢Disordered Eating Behavior: Assessed using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-18), which evaluates three eating behaviors: Cognitive Restraint (CR), Uncontrolled Eating (UE), and Emotional Eating (EE). Items are scored on a Likert scale (1-4) and then scaled between 0-100.
â€¢Personality Traits: Measured using the Big Five Inventory, assessing the following traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
â€¢Social Phobia: A binary measure (Yes/No), as well as the scale score based on the Social Phobia Scale.
â€¢ Emotional Loneliness: Assessed and scored using the DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale.

Statistical Tests:
Three separate multiple linear regression models were fitted, one for each disordered eating behavior, to examine their correlations with social well-being factors.

Limitations:

The survey is cross-sectional, which limits causal inferences. A larger, more diverse sample could provide more generalizable results.

Results:
Cognitive Restraint Model
Social Phobia: Individuals with social phobia exhibit significantly less cognitive restraint (p = 0.002).
Emotional Loneliness: Increased feelings of emotional loneliness are related to a significant increase in cognitive restraint (p = 0.030).

Uncontrolled Eating Model
Loneliness: Increased feelings of loneliness are related to a significant increase in uncontrolled eating (p = 0.001).
Conscientiousness: Individuals who are more conscientious tend to exhibit significantly less uncontrolled eating (p < 0.001).
Openness: Individuals who are more open may exhibit less uncontrolled eating (p = 0.058).

Emotional Eating Model
Social Phobia: Individuals with social phobia tend to exhibit significantly more emotional eating (p = 0.035).
Conscientiousness: Individuals who are more conscientious tend to exhibit significantly less emotional eating (p = 0.004).
Neuroticism: Individuals who are more neurotic tend to exhibit significantly more emotional eating (p = 0.003).
Emotional Social Loneliness: Individuals with more emotional social loneliness tend to exhibit significantly more emotional eating (p = 0.008).


What Factors Correlate Disordered Eating?
(â†‘ = Postive, â†“ = Decrease in behavior; ðŸŸ¥ = Risk Factor, ðŸŸ© = Protective Factor)

Key Takeaways
Loneliness is a Universal Risk Factor risk factor, driving all three disordered eating behaviours.

Social phobia reduces control (â†“ cognitive restraint) and fuels emotional eating.

Conscientiousness, which is characterized by planning and responsibility, has protective effects against impulsive and emotional eating

Neuroticism, or emotional sensitivity, increases emotional eating
