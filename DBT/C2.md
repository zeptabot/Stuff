# EXERCISE 1

## a)
I've tired to use all or nothing thinking - binge out all the way on a day and then fast for 24-48 hours. I've never been able to push through the fasting period is because the hunger is just too miserable. The longest I've been able to push through is slightly less than 48 hours. More often, a little less than 24 hours, I would just lose my mind to the pain and binge out all the way again. I'm just not the kind of person who has the capacity to go on safe, healthy intermittent fasts. At least not yet.
I kept putting of the idea of recieving structured therapy and program help. I lost faith in therapy due to my own pessimistic thinking and noise on the Internet. I thought I could fix this through intermittent fasting, even cherry-picking data on reddit to support my idea. None of that helped. It only fueled my destructive perfectionism.
It has also been a secret, not out of deliberate cover-ups, but simply because I have zero-friends in life and my good-for-nothing parents are just too undereducated to ever realize what's going on.

## b)
The most important thing that helped is a good night sleep. It facilitates a clear mind and not to be controlled by my monkey brain.
The second most important thing is regualr eating. Plan out 3 meals and 2 snaks a day in advance. This regulate my hunger.
Finally, being mindful of my emotions help. I was able to identify the usual cues/trigger and not fall back to old behavior. I think meditation probably played a huge part in enabling that.

## b)
- 1. Health is the most important thing of my life. If I only have one goal in life, it's to live as long and healthy as possible. I've been evaluating all my decisions on this metric because I feel like it's the one thing I won't regret pursuing. I want to be free of disease for as long and possible, because if I don't, and I have to live in fragility, fear, dependence and just misery for the last couple of decades in my life, none of the other stuff (Money, Love, Beauty, Knowledge) would matter. There is no peace in hell. Health is the foundation of all. Also I want a nice body so i could love myself better.
- 2. Inner Peace is a recent realization. It's actually a heuristic for a state of mental well-being. Cuz I'm struggling with eating dsorder, anxiety, mild depression and I know how painful it is to be drowned and torn apart in confusion, hatred, bitterness and the feeling of being lost. I want my demons to be quiet because I know how tormenting it can be when they are not.
- 3. Wisdom is important to me because I belive it would help me stop feeling lost and confused and bitter thus achieving inner peace. When I listen to wise people like Naval Ravikant, I find great power and comfort. I don't want to waste my life chasing the wrong things and ended up regretful and miserable. I want to want the right things and know how to get them.
- 4. Authenticity. I have a strong sense of autonomous oidentity. I refuse to get long hair as my Mom deprately asks because I know life's just easier when my hair is short. I never watched Anime back in China despite every one of my peers was, simply because I decided that I don't like the style and I don't wanna watch stuff in a language I don't understand. I decided to pursue mindfulness and sprituality despite no one else from my background or old social circle gives a shit and sometimes I feel out of place in both communities. But I don't follow trends. I always know exactly if I like or hate something. And I never delve into it unless I know I like it, regardless of what everyone else does.
- 5. Self-Control I value self-control because it gives me a sense of control, self esteem and stability in my life. Exercising every morning, following a rigid diet and wind down for sleep every night help me stay sane and grounded.
