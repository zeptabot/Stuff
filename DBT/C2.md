# EXERCISE 1

## a)
I've tired to use all or nothing thinking - binge out all the way on a day and then fast for 24-48 hours. I've never been able to push through the fasting period is because the hunger is just too miserable. The longest I've been able to push through is slightly less than 48 hours. More often, a little less than 24 hours, I would just lose my mind to the pain and binge out all the way again. I'm just not the kind of person who has the capacity to go on safe, healthy intermittent fasts. At least not yet.
I kept putting of the idea of recieving structured therapy and program help. I lost faith in therapy due to my own pessimistic thinking and noise on the Internet. I thought I could fix this through intermittent fasting, even cherry-picking data on reddit to support my idea. None of that helped. It only fueled my destructive perfectionism.
It has also been a secret, not out of deliberate cover-ups, but simply because I have zero-friends in life and my good-for-nothing parents are just too undereducated to ever realize what's going on.

## b)
The most important thing that helped is a good night sleep. It facilitates a clear mind and not to be controlled by my monkey brain.
The second most important thing is regualr eating. Plan out 3 meals and 2 snaks a day in advance. This regulate my hunger.
Finally, being mindful of my emotions help. I was able to identify the usual cues/trigger and not fall back to old behavior. I think meditation probably played a huge part in enabling that.
