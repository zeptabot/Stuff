I realized just how much longer my history of dealing with emotions using food is then I ever realized. Ever since puberty, I've had trouble socializing and fitting in with the people around me. I always felt isolated and hated everything about myself. I hated that I was fat, that for some reason my personality is obnoxious, that my father's own immature and stupid superiority complex have made be a socially disbaled fuck like they are, and how I always felt underserving in the supposed "Elite" class in middle school because of my relatively shitty grades. Things got worse in senior high when I was literally treated like shit as if I'm a retatrded clown. I turned to the comfort of food and numbed myself with the satisfaction from it. And the reason i would do that goes back even longer. My mom bought and made junk food, like preo, custard tarts and pizza, etc. as a sign of showing love and affection. But we didn't have a good relationship otherwise. So my predispositioned vulnerability to food might not neceessarily be genetic, but a result of my parental issues. Also I've never leearned to deal with anger properly because of my Dad's smashing and beatings. I hate arguing with people and I've sworn to never drink alchohol. Both because of my Dad. Thinking about my childhood made me realize how difficult it has been to deal with chronic loneliness and anger. Recogonizing these cues have enabled me to not fall into the old patterns so often.
