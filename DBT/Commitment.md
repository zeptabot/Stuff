## Commitment
In order to stop myself from falling into poverty, I need to stop binge eating. 

In order to break free from disgust and hatred, I need to stop binge eating. 

In order to no longer be tormented by my own mind, my own body and the environment I live in, I need to stop binge eating. 

In order to love myself and be able to love others, fostering genuine and healthy connections, I need to stop binge eating. 

In order to live as long and healthy as possible on this Earth, I will stop binge eating and turn to the DBT Solution for Emotional Eating Program.

In order to be actually alive, I will turn to this program **first** instead of turning to food as way of coping with emotional distress.

I commit.
