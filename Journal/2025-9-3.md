# Worries
1. I'm worried that I won't keep up with all my academic & social demands due to poor time management.
 - Establish a daily routine of updating your calender and making next day's schedule.
 - No matter what, GET SUFFICIENT QUALITY AND DURATION OF SLEEP!!!!!!!!

2. I'm worried that this state of wellbeing won't last and I'll slip back into the darkness
- Keep up with theapy and medication
- Daily: Green Tara, Medicine Buddha, Mindfulness Meditation
- When ready, another Mushroom Trip
