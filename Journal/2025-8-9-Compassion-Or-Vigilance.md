# Is this compassion or vigilance?

Yesterday I was walking around in Hart House minding my own business when, suddenly, I felt an subtle, alarmed and even hostile look being quickly thrown my way. It lasted for less than a second, but I still pick it up. 

I turned my head to the side, and there he is: A skinny, short, silent and dull brown skinned Indian, around my age, with square glassess, unstyled hair, and zero sexual attraction. I don't know if he's an isolated international student like me, but that moment I knew, for a fact, that he was going through some similar shit.

He's just standing there all alone, not studying or talking, not even on his phone. Instead he's just putting down his bag on the bench chair with really slow movement, and just looking upfront like he's thinking about something. 

But yet he threw me, some random guy, a dirty look of alert. Why? Cuz he's in distress. He feels alienated by the vibrant environment aorund him. And he doesnt even have access to a more private spot to do whatever he wanted to do. I could tell he's either depressed or in anxeity or possibly both. Everyhing around him tells him he is a loser. He might not know it, but deep down any one who walks toward him is seen as a threat and he hates everyone who's having it at life. 

With that one dirty look, and one impression of his form, I knew him. Because I've benn through the same shit. I feel distressed too. I kept looking back at him depsite wanting to get out of there as soon as possible. I was in grief. The world feels so unfair. Why do we have to suffer like this? What did we do? Can you imagine being rejected, isolated and spat at by every single love and acceptance you ever attempted to reach? And even then, unlike people who were able to take spriritual refuge in religion, in the church or the sangha, or in their family, or even just their money, there's absolutely nothing having our back, stopping us from literally going insane and to eternal torture? 

The healthcare system is shit and the chance of actually healing through treatment or genuine relationship basically zero. Eternal loneliness. The ultimate hell. And some of us stay there till the end of our life. It's unfair. How can you expect anyone to accept, or even understand concepts such as love, compassion, friendship, and justice? 

I went through a dark time when, riding to school, I felt like shouting furiously with the meanest words at the car going parallel to me because there's a chance of it hitting me. Other Chinese internationao students talk about the crazy homeless people on the street who curses loudly and shouts and stares at people like a lunatic. but I genuienly relate to them. Sometimes I wana do that too. Spit all my hatred out right at this fucked up world - and that includes everyone - because I couldnt hold it in anymore. 

I'm in a better place somewhat now, but the psychedelics made me more connected to my emotions, and I could see they're all still there, very real, burning inside like black poison. 
These are the same words I would have written when I'm in that state, except now I'm mindful, and I'm observing these thoughts, and I know salvation is possible and love is real. Hold on to that. But how do I hold on to that? By writng this out, I feel like slipoing back into that darkness again. How do I stop? For me, CBT never worked for emotion regulation, only neglect and suppression, until eventual burnout.

Grok pointed out the the neuroplasticity induced by psychedelics is merely a spark to change for the better, not the fuel. I believe that I was able to feel all this that day due to becoming more compassionate and more connected to my emotions as a result of my trip, not my old pattern of hateful thinking. However, I agree with Grok when it says if my baseline state is hypervigilance and cynical hostility, then a trip without proper guidance could amplify that instead of helping. It's a real risk, and that makes post trip integration super important. I'm going to see a psychotherapist about all this and this time, take it seriosuly, and do actual DBT/ACT. I will take this second chance at life seriously.
