# My first psychedelic trip

Today I went on my first ever psychedelic trip—2.5 g of Golden Teacher taken in the morning. The sensual experience was hard to put into words. To be clear, I didn't see or hear anything funny. All I felt was wave after wave of pure bliss. and in different styles too! Sometimes it's like the inside of my head exploded with euphoria, like I was electrocuted, and I can't help but laugh it out loud like a lunatic. Sometimes it was like drifting away on a sea of soothing, eternal bliss, and my whole body was melting into my blanket, while my mind was melting into that bliss.

Unexpectedly, my mind kept making parallels to sex. I was hoping for something more spiritual—the Source, the Universe, etc. I'm also very interested in Buddhism and wanted to enrich my understanding of compassion and non-self. Instead of ego-death, I thought about how similar the bliss was to being dominated and fucked, and how I wanted to replicate it by finding someone to do that with me. I guess that's because I've never had sex. I saw that deep down, I crave intimacy and need to explore it to be disenchanted with it. I kept calling to myself "Hello, baby" and I tbh I don't know how to feel about that. I realized that if I were ordained as a monk now, I'd just be one of those exposed for sexual misconduct decades later. The desire is extremely difficult to bypass through religion, despite the concrete path being 100% clear. I wouldn't bet on myself successfully staying celibate my whole life if I quit my entire life and go join a temple, study dharma full-time right now. It's probably better to explore this part of samsara and let karma decide how close I get to the Three Jewels, instead of chasing that goal unnaturally.

And that means putting myself out there. I always thought I had to work out and get in shape first. But focusing solely on getting fit only gave me an eating disorder, which means I would probably never get in shape. Although I'm in bad shape, I don't look fat with clothes on yet. That's already in a better position than a lot of people, and I guess I have to make as much of what I have. Work on hygiene and dating and everything, and don't be so afraid. That leads to the next part.

I realized that all my fear and hatred come from the unknown. I think this is what's supposed to be the compassion or ego-death part of my trip. When I see a person high on drugs and walking the street as if on a Runway, why do I feel distressed, even if they're harmless? It's because my brain, a prediction machine, fails to predict their state of mind, or what does it have to be thinking or doing for me to act in the same way. When I feel resentful toward a rich international student scrolling TikTok on his iPad during office hours, it's not because he doesn't belong; it's because I can't comprehend his mindset, making him "other." It's a failure of empathy from a lack of data. And finally, the fear of death. As a materialist, one could understand the biology of death as well as the "discontinuation of consciousness". However, when the monkey brain tries to comprehend that message, it only returns N/A. It's just impossible for it to predict its own non-existence. This prediction failure is the ultimate unknown, and that creates "fear of death". Seeing this process helps me fear death less. I might start chasing near death experience. But that's for another day.

I also realized just how obssessed I was with my own rigid worldview. At one point, I'm visualizing the practice of a particular religion, which I have decided that I disagree with. I didn't want to be drawn to that religion due to this psychedelic trip, so I immediately interrupted the playlist and inserted songs from a religion I prefer, attempting to manipulate the experience. Now I realized its probably pointless. This perfectionist obsession with what was "right" was probably the root cause of my problems: the right political ideology, the right outfit, the right diet, the right routine, the right path forward, the right mathematical proof etc.The phrase "perfect is the enemy of good" dawned on me profoundly; perfectionism was literally killing me, as it caused my eating disorder.

Finally, I realized just how obsessed I was with investigating and conceptualizing everything with reason and words. When I was high and all, I kept thinking to myself: "How should I put this into words? Something exploding, something melting, something dissolving. I realized what's being blown apart is all the old connections in my neurons, and it's beautiful and euphoric, and it's the happiest I've ever been my entire life. But what's that something exactly, not biologically, but spiritually?" Then I realized that language, being a tool specifically evolved to let our hunter-gatherers cooperate on, well, hunting and gathering, could only address a limited facet of the complexity of spirituality and the universe, whcih is beyond words in nature. And my desire to "understand" everything along my walk on life with words probably fueled a lot of my misery too.

I took the trip because I was stuck deep in a non-purging bulimia and borderline BED (which developed from untrated, pseudo-recovered aneroxia) as a broke international student with 0 friends and insufficient access to health care. (The odds of curing my eating disorder through professional treatment is infinitesimally small). Also, I have not been a functional adult. My final exam is in eleven days, and I'm two weeks behind on studying. I can't commit to a schedule. My habits are shit: excessive social media, poor sleep hygiene. This binge-eating hell has wrecked my anterior mid-cingulate cortex (willpower) and prefrontal cortex (decision-making). I needed a reset.

Now, I feel refreshed. I'm willing to give life a second try. I was once a stoic, disciplined high-performer and health fanatic until I snapped. Looking back, two things accumulated stress, leading to the eventual burnout. First, I was too much of a perfectionist. Underneath that is weakness. You have to get a perfect score, or you condemn yourself. That is NOT an adaptive way to live on this Earth. I HAVE to be able to live with fucking up on this course. It will affect my GPA and my chance at a specific master's program, but I won't suffer for eternity. There are other ways to live a virtuous life. That resilience is important. Second, social isolation. I need to start trying to find my people, starting small with that group I'm hesitating about. I know shrooms aren't the solution. They merely give you the will to try again and make the pillars of energy solid again. I'm going to live this second life differently.

I feel like I need another trip, though. This one with Golden Teacher addressed too little about ego, compassion, and trauma. I need something that shows me my trauma and gives me the experience of ego-death and non-duality, leading to compassion. Probably something other than Golden Teachers. I'll do my research on that. But Gemini 2.5 Pro told me this was just my perfectionism speaking again, so I don't know.


今天我进行了人生中的第一次迷幻之旅——早上吃了 2.5 克黄金教师。那种感官体验难以用语言描述。说清楚一点，我并没有看到或听到什么奇怪的东西。我感到的只是，一波又一波纯粹的极乐，而且风格各有不同！有时候，就像我脑子里面炸开了一样，充满了愉悦，像被电击了一样，我忍不住像个疯子似的大声笑出声来。有时候又像是在一片平静、永恒的幸福海洋上漂流，我的整个身体融进毯子里，而我的思绪融进那份幸福之中。

出乎意料的是，我的脑子不断把这种感觉跟性联系起来。我本来是希望能有更灵性的体验——本源、宇宙之类的东西。我也很感兴趣佛教，想通过这次体验去丰富对慈悲和无我的理解。可并没有所谓的“自我死亡”，反而我一直在想，这种幸福和被支配、被干（肛交）是多么相似，而且我想通过找到一个人来那样对我，以复制这种体验。我想这大概是因为我从未有过性经历。我看到内心深处其实渴望亲密，需要去探索它，才可能对它失去幻想。我不断对自己喊“Hello, baby”，老实说我也不知道该怎么对此感受。我意识到如果我现在去出家当和尚，几十年后很可能会成为那种被曝出性丑闻的僧人。尽管出家之路表面上是百分之百清晰的，这种欲望通过宗教来压制还是极其困难。从概率上讲，我不会赌自己能一辈子守贞——即便我现在退出整个人生、去寺庙全职学佛也是一样。或许更好的办法是先去探索这部分轮回，让业力自己决定我能离三宝多近，而不是做出不自然的追求。

这也意味着我要把自己放出去。我一直以为必须先锻炼、先把身材练好。但只一味追求健身只给我带来了饮食失调，这意味着我可能永远也练不出理想身材。虽然我身材很糟，但穿衣服看起来还不算胖。相比很多人这已经是个好开端了，我要尽力把现有条件用好。工作在卫生习惯、约会技巧等方面，不要太害怕。这又引出下一点。

我意识到我所有的恐惧和仇恨都来自“未知”。我想这也是这次旅行中所谓的慈悲或自我消解的部分。当我看到一个嗑药后在街上像在走秀一样走的人，即便他并无害处，我为什么会感觉不安？是因为我的大脑——一个预测机器——无法预测他的心理状态，或者无法想象自己在什么情况下会以那样的方式行动。当我对一个在办公时间里拿着 iPad 刷 TikTok 的有钱留学生感到愤恨时，并不是因为他“不属于这里”，而是我无法理解他的心态，于是把他当作“他者”。这是一种因缺乏数据而产生的共情失败。最后是对死亡的恐惧。作为唯物主义者，可以理解死亡的生物学以及“意识的终止”。然而，当猴子脑试图去理解这个信息时，它只会返回“无解”。它根本预测不了自身的不存在。这种预测失败就是死亡恐惧的终极来源。看到这个过程让我对死亡的恐惧减轻了。我可能会开始追求濒死体验，但那是以后再说的事。

我还意识到我对自己僵化世界观的痴迷。有一刻，我脑中浮现出某个我不认同的宗教的修行场景。我不想因为这次迷幻之旅而被吸引到那个宗教，于是我立刻暂停播放列表，插入我偏好的宗教歌曲，试图操纵体验。现在我意识到这很可能是徒劳的。这种对“对”的完美主义执念可能是我问题的根源：正确的政治立场、正确的穿搭、正确的饮食、正确的作息、正确的人生道路、正确的数学证明等等。“完美是良好的敌人”这句话让我深受触动；完美主义几乎要了我的命，因为它导致了我的饮食失调。

最后，我意识到自己有多么沉迷于用理性和语言去审视和概念化一切。当我在高峰体验中，我不停地想着：“我该怎么把这感觉写成文字？像爆炸、融化、溶解。”我意识到被炸开的，正是脑中那些陈旧的神经连接，这很美，很愉悦，是我有生以来最快乐的时刻。但那究竟是什么呢？不是从生物学角度，而是从精神层面？随后我意识到，语言作为一种工具，是为让我们的狩猎采集祖先协作而进化出来的，它只能触及精神和宇宙复杂性的一小部分，而这些本质上是超越语言的。我用语言去“理解”一切的欲望，大概也是促成我痛苦的一个重要原因。

我服用迷幻药是因为我陷在严重的非清除型贪食症和接近暴食的地狱里（这是未经治疗、伪康复的厌食症发展而来），而且我是一个身无分文、没有朋友、医疗资源不足的留学生。（通过专业治疗治愈我当前的饮食失调的概率几乎可以忽略不计。）另外，我也没能作为一个功能性成年人生活。我的期末考试还有十一天，而我已经落后两周。我无法坚持一个计划。我的习惯一团糟：过度使用社交媒体、糟糕的睡眠习惯。这种暴食地狱摧毁了我的前扣带回（意志力）和前额叶皮层（决策能力）。我需要一次重置。

现在，我感觉焕然一新。我愿意再给生活一次机会。我曾是个坚忍、自律、效率高的健康狂，直到崩溃。回头看，有两件事堆积造成了最终的倦怠。第一，我太完美主义了。本质上那是脆弱。你必须拿到完美分数，否则就自我谴责。这不是在地球上适应良好的生活方式。我必须学会接受自己把这门课搞砸的事实。这会影响我的绩点和申请某个硕士项目的机会，但我不会因此受苦一辈子。还有别的方式可以有意义地生活。这种韧性很重要。第二，是社会隔离。我需要开始尝试找到属于我的人，从我犹豫要加入的那个小组开始。我知道蘑菇不是解决方案。它们只是给了你再次尝试的意愿，并让能量的支柱重新稳固。我将以不同的方式去过这第二次人生。

不过，我觉得我还需要再来一次旅行。这次黄金教师对自我、慈悲和创伤的触及太少了。我需要一些能让我直面创伤、体验自我消解与非二元并引向慈悲的东西。可能需要换另一种菌株。但 Gemini 2.5 Pro 告诉我这只是我的完美主义又在作祟，所以我也不确定。
